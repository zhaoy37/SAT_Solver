    "Imagine that you are provided with a boolean formula P and asked to determine if P is satisfiable. P is satisfiabile if there exists values for each variable such that P evaluates to true. For example, the formula $P = (x1 \\wedge x2) \\vee x3$ is satisfiable because there exists a model {x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 0} such that the the boolean formula evaluates to true. On the contrary, $P = (x1 \\wedge \\neg x1)$ is not satisfiable. Validity means that the formula evaluates to true for all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication of SAT solving is theoretically supported by the Cook-Levin Theorem, which states that Boolean SAT is NP-complete. Equivalently, any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing Machine to a SAT problem. Therefore, many classical NP-complete problems in algorithms, such as graph coloring and sudoku, can be encoded into a SAT Problem representation and solved via a SAT solver."

    "## The DPLL Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm (DPLL) is a widely used algorithm in SAT solving. Its basic idea is recursive backtracking search of atom values that meet the satisfiability with some special heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we briefly discuss the heuristics used in DPLL: There are two parts of the search algorithm in DPLL. In the recursive backtracking search, the algorithm first decides an assignment. Then, it deduces the assignment by substituting the atoms in the SAT formula with the assignment. If the valuation returns False, the algorithm backtracks to try another assignment if such new assignment is possible. If the algorithm runs out of assignments, the algorithm returns UNSAT. The heuristics in DPLL revolve around heuristics in deciding and deducing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One heuristic in assigning is **Early termination**, which refers to terminating the algorithm if any realization of a variable leads to True or False of a SAT formula regardless the choice of any other variables. If the algorithmn returns False in the early termination, faster backtracking is encouraged. If the algorithm returns True in the early termination, on the other hand, faster path to a solution is found. To give a concrete example, $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C)$ is satisfied by {A = True}.\n",
    "\n",
    "One heuristic for deciding assignments is **Pure literals**, which states that if all occurrences of a symbol in the clause (assuming a negation normal form) have the same sign accross the clause, we can guess that the symbol is True (if the symbol is positive) or False (if the symbol is negative). This can be done with the assumption that any \"not\" nodes far away from the leaf nodes are transformed to become the parents of the leaf nodes using the rules of De Morgan's Law and double negations (i.e. the SAT formula is in NNF). For instance, in $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (C \\vee \\neg B)$, the symbol A is pure and positive. By the heuristic, we should prioritize the decision of setting A to True over setting A to False in the search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another heuristic in assigning is **Unit Clauses**, which states that for any clause left with a single literal, we can simplify the clause by realizing that symbol. More broadly speaking, assignments to variables can lead to simplifications. For instance, in the case of {A = False} with $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C)$, the clause can be simplified to $(B) \\wedge (\\neg C)$\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "The above heuristics are what we implement in the DPLL solver. There are some more advanced heuristics that can increase the efficiency of the solver that we do not cover in our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we begin with our function to simplify a Boolean formula following necessary heuristics."

    "A Binary Decision Tree (BDT) is a tree structure that is commonly used to represent logical formulas. In a BDT, the nodes of the tree represent variables, and the branches represent the values that these variables can take on. Specifically, the branch where its parent node evaluates to true is called the high branch, while the branch where its parent node evaluates to false is called the low branch. The high branch leads to the high child of a parent node, while the low branch leads to the low child of a parent. The leaf nodes of a BDT evaluate to either true or false, which are the outcomes of the test values of each variable. When using ROBDD for SAT solving, we follow the same logic structure and parser as introduced above. "

    "## Background on SMT Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMT problem is similar to the SAT Problem with the exception that the formulas are many-sorted. In our project, we only consider the SMT problem over integer predicates with no support for arithmetic operators that are not in the set of $=, \\le, \\ge, <, >, \\neq, +, -, *, //$ because this representation scheme is all we need to solve the problems in the /problems folder. However, such scheme can be easily expanded to a broader set of operators and predicate domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of an SMT problem is: $(y1 \\le 2) \\wedge (y2 = 3)$. This SMT formula is satisifed by $\\{\"y1\" : 0, \"y2\" : 3\\}$. We will create a function **solve_SMT** to solve SMT problems. The function accepts 5 parameters as a representation of the SMT formula to be solved:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**sat_formula**: The SAT encoding of the SMT clauses. Semantically, each atom in the encoding maps to one SMT subclause (True and False are not used in sat_formula for SMT encoding). For instance, for the formula $(y1 \\le 2) \\wedge (y2 = 3)$, the sat_formula parameter is [\"and\", \"x1\", \"x2\"], where \"x1\" and \"x2\" map to the two SMT subclauses $(y1 \\le 2)$ and $(y2 = 3)$ respectively. The syntax follows the following BNF:\n",

    "Now, let's try the minconflicts method. The kernel uses the min-conflicts algorithm commonly used for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problem. The algorithm first randomly initializes the values (given the bounds) for the set of all SMT variables. While the assignment does not satisfy the formula, the algorithm randomly pick a variable from all the set of SMT variables that result in conflict(s), and find the value that best reduces the conflicts associated with that variable to update the assignment (the value found is equivalent to the value that best reduces the conflicts in the existing state of the assignment). The algorithm terminates when an assignment is found to satisfy the SMT formula or when the maximum number of iteration steps is achieved. **Please note that \"UNSAT\" may be found even if there exists a solution if the maximum iteration steps is not sufficiently large.** However, this approach can be faster than the naive backtracking approach when applied to some of our NP-complete problem solver(s) such as the N-queens problem solver."

The default SMT kernel used for this solver is backtracking.\n",

The two arguments are graph, which is an adjacency list representation of a graph, and num_colors, which denotes the maximum number of colors allowed to color the graph. The function returns the assignment of chromatic numbers to each node if the problem is solvable (if the node does not appear in the assignment, it can be any color within the set of all chromatic numbers). In the case of an unsolvable problem, the solver returns \"UNSAT\".\n",

    "\n",
    "The Partition Problem is NP-complete, and is defined below for our solver implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list L, of integers, partition L into two sublists such that the sum of one sublist equals the sum of the other sublist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only focus on integer lists because the SMT solver we implement only work for integer predicates. The default SMT kernel for this solver is backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write the solve_partition function. There is one required parameter, target_list, which is the list, L, to be analyzed. When the solver returns \"UNSAT\", the algorithm reports infeasibility. Otherwise, upon a successful completion, the solver returns two sublists that form the partition of the target list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the solver encodes each index of the list to a variable (y_i) with a potential values in {0, 1}. Then, the SMT_encoding represents sum(y_i * L[i]) * 2 == sum(L[i]). Thus, All variables that have the same assigned value form one group. The algorithm treats the two groups as the partition of the target list. In our SMT encoding, we also dictate that the sum of all y_i cannot be 0 or the length of the target list to prevent the case where a group among the two groups is an empty set."
