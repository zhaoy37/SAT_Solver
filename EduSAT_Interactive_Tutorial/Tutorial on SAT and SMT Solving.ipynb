P is satisfiabile if there exists values for each variable such that P evaluates to true. For example, the formula $P = (x1 \\wedge x2) \\vee x3$ is satisfiable because there exists a model {x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 0} such that the the boolean formula evaluates to true. On the contrary, $P = (x1 \\wedge \\neg x1)$ is not satisfiable. Validity means that the formula evaluates to true for all models.\n","\n","The implication of SAT solving is theoretically supported by the Cook-Levin Theorem, which states that Boolean SAT is NP-complete. Equivalently, any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing Machine to a SAT problem. Therefore, many classical NP-complete problems in algorithms, such as graph coloring and sudoku, can be encoded into a SAT Problem representation and solved via a SAT solver."],"metadata":{"id":"cXDdBOBX2sti"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## An Auxiliary Structure: A Logic Tree\n","\n","The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm (DPLL) is a widely used algorithm in SAT solving.

Its basic idea is recursive backtracking search of atom values that meet the satisfiability with some special heuristics.\n","\n","Now, we briefly discuss the heuristics used in DPLL: There are two parts of the search algorithm in DPLL. In the recursive backtracking search, the algorithm first decides an assignment. Then, it deduces the assignment by substituting the atoms in the SAT formula with the assignment. If the valuation returns False, the algorithm backtracks to try another assignment if such new assignment is possible. If the algorithm runs out of assignments, the algorithm returns UNSAT. The heuristics in DPLL revolve around heuristics in deciding and deducing.\n","\n","One heuristic in assigning is **Early termination**, which refers to terminating the algorithm if any realization of a variable leads to True or False of a SAT formula regardless the choice of any other variables. If the algorithmn returns False in the early termination, faster backtracking is encouraged. If the algorithm returns True in the early termination, on the other hand, faster path to a solution is found. To give a concrete example, $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C)$ is satisfied by {A = True}.\n","\n","One heuristic for deciding assignments is **Pure literals**, which states that if all occurrences of a symbol in the clause (assuming a negation normal form) have the same sign accross the clause, we can guess that the symbol is True (if the symbol is positive) or False (if the symbol is negative). This can be done with the assumption that any \"not\" nodes far away from the leaf nodes are transformed to become the parents of the leaf nodes using the rules of De Morgan's Law and double negations (i.e. the SAT formula is in NNF). For instance, in $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (C \\vee \\neg B)$, the symbol A is pure and positive. By the heuristic, we should prioritize the decision of setting A to True over setting A to False in the search algorithm.\n","\n","Another heuristic in assigning is **Unit Clauses**, which states that for any clause left with a single literal, we can simplify the clause by realizing that symbol. More broadly speaking, assignments to variables can lead to simplifications. For instance, in the case of {A = False} with $(A \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee \\neg C)$, the clause can be simplified to $(B) \\wedge (\\neg C)$\n",".\n","\n","The above heuristics are what we implement in the DPLL solver.

In our project, we only consider the SMT problem over integer predicates with no support for arithmetic operators that are not in the set of $=, \\le, \\ge, <, >, \\neq, +, -, *, //$ because this representation scheme is all we need to solve the problems in the /problems folder. However, such scheme can be easily expanded to a broader set of operators and predicate domains.\n","\n","One example of an SMT problem is: $(y1 \\le 2) \\wedge (y2 = 3)$. This SMT formula is satisifed by $\\{\"y1\" : 0, \"y2\" : 3\\}$. We will create a function **solve_SMT** to solve SMT problems. The function accepts 5 parameters as a representation of the SMT formula to be solved:\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","**sat_formula**: The SAT encoding of the SMT clauses. Semantically, each atom in the encoding maps to one SMT subclause (True and False are not used in sat_formula for SMT encoding). For instance, for the formula $(y1 \\le 2) \\wedge (y2 = 3)$, the sat_formula parameter is [\"and\", \"x1\", \"x2\"], where \"x1\" and \"x2\" map to the two SMT subclauses $(y1 \\le 2)$ and $(y2 = 3)$ respectively. The syntax follows the following BNF:\n","$<sat\\_formula> := <atom> | [\"and\", <sat\\_formula>, <sat\\_formula>] | [\"or\", <sat\\_formula>, <sat\\_formula>] | [\"not\", <sat\\_formula>]$\n","\n","$<atom> := r\"x[0-9]+\"$\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","**encodings**: The SMT encoding is a dictionary mapping each atom from the SAT encoding to an SMT clause. For the formula $(y1 \\le 2) \\wedge (y2 = 3)$, the SMT encoding is $\\{\"x1\" : [\"le\", \"y1\", 2], \"x2\" : [\"eq\", \"y2\", 3]\\}$. The syntax follows the following BNF:\n","\n","$<smt\\_formula> := [<operator>, <expression>, <expression>]$\n","\n","$<operator> := \"le\" | \"ge\" | \"eq\" | \"lt\" | \"gt\" | \"nq\"$\n","\n","$<expression>$ is any integer or string with mathematical expressions with allowed operators without using r'x[0-9]\\*' or r'X[0-9]\\*'.\n","\n","Semantically, \"le\" stands for $\\le$, \"ge\" stands for $\\ge$, \"lt\" stands for <, \"gt\" stands for >, \"eq\" stands for =, and \"nq\" stands for $\\neq$. The SMT formula $[<operator>, <expression1>, <expression2>]$ represents $<expression1> <operator> <expression2>$. For example, [\"lt\", \"y1\", 2] means y1 < 2, and [\"nq\", \"y1 + 3 * y2\", \"y2\"] means $y1 + 3 * y2 \\neq y2$.\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","**smt_vars**: This is the list of all the variables used in the SMT encoding. For the example of $(y1 \\le 2)$ and $(y2 = 3)$, this would be [\"y1\", \"y2\"].\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","**lowerbound**: Semantically, this is the lower bound of the search space (the lower bound of that any SMT variable can be assigned to). If the solution is outside of the search space, we do not guarantee the correctness.\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","**upperbound**: Semantically, this is the upper bound of the search space (the upper bound of that any SMT variable can be assigned to).
